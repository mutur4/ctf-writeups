*Static Analysis*
- As usual lets chek the file type and the backend codingstrcspn
- The file is a `dynamically linked` and `not stripped` file written in `c`
- Check the for the `imports` and `strings` in the binary. Well I have to admit `strcspn` looked new and intrestinf
- Looking it up online this is a function is `C` that : assume strscpn(str1, str2). If str2 is found in str1 this function will
return the number letters before `str2` get it :)
- No other new or interesting import lets dive in to the favourite part using the debugger.


*Dynamic Analysis*

- Load you favourite debugger and lets get started. This will be an easy binary to anaylse 
since there binary is `not stripped` and its dynamically linked.
- There are a couple of functions in the binary 

**give_flag**

- This is a function that gives the flag therefore we should find a way to call it.

**Main**
- This is the entry function and as seen we allocated `0x200` space for local 
variable and `memset` is used to fill up the buffer with `0`'s
- It then prompts us for our name and uses `strcspn` to find `\n` in the string
which will be replaced by a null byte. This happens because `fgets` that is used to 
read in input appends a new line at the end.
- It then presents us with a menu where we can add, delete and change names and exit.

**Menu**

- This is used to print the menu.

**Add User**

- This is used to add a user on the stack. Our input ends up on the `0x200` space that 
was allocated earlier.
- This function also does some checks before adding a user of the stack.
```
1. It adds each users at an offset of 32 bytes. This is done using the opcode `shl rax, 0x5`
2. Before adding a user it check if the region in memory starts with a null byte.
3. There are no limits we can add upto as many users as we want. Can we use this privillege
and cause a buffer overflow. Well we'll see later.
4. `strcspn` is also used to eliminate a `\n` character and `fgets` is used to get our input
but it only allows `0x20` characters.
```

**Print Users**

- This is used to print users from the buffer allocated earlier.
- The maximum number of users that can be printed is `0xf` 
- It iterates through the offset of 32 byte from the buffer to find users.
- If there is a null byte at the start of the buffer then is assumes there are no more users and exists.

**Delete User**
- This is used to delete a user in that it replaces the buffer with null bytes.
- It then calls a function `shift back` that is used to shift back a user into 
the previous buffer that was deleted.

**change_uname**
- This alows us to change the user name of the user.
- It takes an index and we can edit that buffer win our new user.
- On amazing thing is that this function uses fgets to get our input but the max
number of bytes is `0x50` which is diffrent from the usual `0x20` in the add_user function.
- Therefore this is where the vulnerability lies.

## Exploit

- We have to add users and fill the buffer so that we can edit a user and overflow to the 
control rip.
- But there is a problem. `add_user` function checks for a `null` byte at the beginning of
a buffer to add a user.
- To mitigate this remember the first prompt. `Enter your name`. Filling this buffer with 
`0x20` bytes `strcspn` will replace the last buffer with a null byte and since this region 
lies in the 32 byte offset our input will go here.
- We can then edit the value at this region and since `edit` allows us to enter 0x50 bytes 
we can therefore overflow the saved pointer and call `give_flag` function.
- Final exploit [exploit](exploit.py)
