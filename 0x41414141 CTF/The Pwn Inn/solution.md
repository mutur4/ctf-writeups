## Challenge Overview 

This was a 64-bit executable file that was dynamically linked and was not stripped. The protections included `Partil RELRO` and `NO PIE`.
The executable asked for some input and printed it back. Therefore I had to check for a  `format string bug` :/ and boom there was a 
format string bug.

## Exploit Overview

I used the format string bug to overwrite the `exit()` function's `got` with the address of `vuln` this was used to give me recursive calls to 
vuln and therefore recursive `reads` and `writes`.

I leaked the address of the `got entry` of `puts` to leak the libc address to find the offset to `system` online. Finally to get a shell I overwrote the `got` 
entry of `printf` with system. 
Therefore whenever we pass in our input via `fgets` it is passed through `system` instead of `printf`.

The final exploit is @ [exploit](exploit.py)


## Flag 

After spwaning a shell the flag is therefore

flag{GOTt4_b3_OVERWRITEing_th0s3_symb0ls_742837423}
