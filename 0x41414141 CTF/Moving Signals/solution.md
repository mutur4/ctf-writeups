## Challenge Overview

The given file is a 64-bit executable that is statically linked and that is not stripped.

## Exploit Overview 

Following the challenge's description `Moving Signals` we conclude that the challenge can be exploited via `srop` technique.This technique 
can work under the following conditions. Read more [here](https://amriunix.com/post/sigreturn-oriented-programming-srop/)
  > Buffer overflow to overwrite the stack return address
  
  >`syscall` and `rax` gadgets that can be used to call sigreturn syscall.
  
  > There should be enough space on the stack to be used to sigcontext frame.
 
Does this Binary meet all these conditions?
  > There is a buffer overflow at offset `0x8`
  >
  > There is a `syscall` and `pop_rax` gadget in the binary file.
  >
  > There is enough space that we can write on the stack because `syscall_read` max input check is `0x1f4`
  
 Therefore the exploit will be as follows
  
  `exploit=b'A'*8 + pop_rax + 0xf + syscall + frame`
  
 We can now control the value of out registers including `rip` therefore we determine the next instruction to execute.
 I decided to call `execve` because there was `/bin/sh` provided to us in the binary. :/

 ## Flag 
 The flag after spawning a shell was:
 `flag{s1gROPp1ty_r0p_321321}`
